For an "always learner" in software development, finding training and guidance on technical topics can be difficult. What do you need to know? How should you approach the topic? Is there a preferred route through the topic?

Not long ago I ran across [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) and have watched it grow. It went from an initial visual roadmap around a core set of development skills and professions to a full-on guidance system for almost any important role or skill in the tech field.

From the site, simply pick a topic of interest and see a "roadmap" of the types of skills you'll need to have for that role or skill displayed in a flowchart'ish diagram - a "syllabus" on the entire topic with different paths/routes outlined depending on your interest. Clicking on a piece of the syllabus "flow" will describe what it entails - usually with some contextual links for further reading. If you create an account you can track your progress. There's even a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA0H2KIWgWTwpTFjSxp0now) for different topical material.

It's been amazing watching this project grow! It's been fueled in large part by the open-source nature - it's hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) - and naturally available to anyone. You can even contribute if you like.

What Roadmap.sh isn't is a credential giving/weilding training site for all things technical. It's a well throughout guide to what it takes to be competent in a particular field or skill. You'll still need to seek out your own training material, classes, bootcamps, etc.. but at least you'll be armed with better knowledge about what topics the training material should cover. There's a lot of educational material out there and Roadmap.sh helps you make better sense of what's necessary, in what order, and what certain specializations are expected to know.  

So, if you're looking to expand your skill set or look into a different carear path, check out Roadmap.sh to explore what's out there, how to go about learning, and - most importantly - making sense of it.
