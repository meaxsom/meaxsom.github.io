Tomorrow I'll do something I haven't done in 27 years - start a new job. At 60, it's not something I planned but rather was "thrust upon" me - as my father would say. It's still a development job. It's still software, but it's different. I'll be "closer to the code" again after being away in management/executive leadership for many years. I'm actually looking forward to NOT being at the "edge of technology" for a change - no late night system/server issues, no pager duty, etc. I'm hoping for a lot less of the issues that created the immense stress I felt over the 3 years leading up to my layoff.

In the intervening 2 months between my layoff and now, I've been lucky enough to be able to stop, think a lot about what direction I want to go in, and understand what adjustments I'll have to make to get there. I don't have all the answers yet, but I know enough that living on the "high tech" side - both in coding and management is probably over for me and that's by choice. I lived that life for 27 years. I learned a heck of a lot, met a lot of great people - and some not so great ones too. I'll carry those years with me - the good and not so good - forever but it's behind me now and everything else is ahead of me.

In the last week while dusting off some old skills I'll need for my new job, my random playlist kicked out a song called “Ahead of Me” by [Vinnie Paolizzi](https://www.vinniepaolizzimusic.com/).

 I don't pretend to know if this is his work or a cover - he's new to me - but that song spoke right to where I'm at and my best days being "ahead of me". He sings a number of analogies in the song about new happenings on old things - new leaves on old trees, fresh strings on an old guitar, etc. He captures in that song, exactly where I feel like I'm at: starting over - more or less - at 60. I'm older but I'm not done yet and what's ahead of me are my "best days". 

So tomorrow - as I actually drive to and go into a physical office for the first time in about 4 years - I'm anxious, nervous, and excited all at the same time. There's a lot that'll change in my life because of this but I feel like the best is yet to come.

Wish me luck!
