My how time flies. The "journey" is now almost 5 months old and - while there is still a lot to learn - much has already been learned:
- Leaving Mac and Linux behind for Windows 11 has been interesting but installing [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) has helped when it has been needed.
- FileMaker mechanics - building UIs, working with Table Occurrences/Relationships, and Scripting - are becoming really familiar.
- Leaving the internet world (HTML/CCS/Web Services/etc) behind was easier than I thought
- Leaving executive management behind was easier than I thought
- Making an immediate impact in the lives of people using the system is high
- Stress is low
- Co-workers are great
- Company builds amazing homes and produces incredible millwork

That's the primary list. On the more abstract end, there's a freedom with development work I've not had in a long, long time. It's easy to get lost in developing a really nice solution/extension/update/feature that meets a defined need and having an immediate feedback from your userbase. Not having to produce software that's the front-line, money making asset is something completely new. It is nice being in a supportive/behind the scenes role. At the moment, it's a wonderful, creative, stress reduced niche to be in.

Some things that are peaking my interest as my roll starts to evolve beyond just developing database solutions:
- Learning [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.4)   
  Diving a bit into the system admin part of the job is where this will be useful. Some sleuthing for a resource lead me to [PowerShell in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches) as a guidebook.
- [Zoho Assist](https://www.zoho.com/assist/) interesting platform used for “remoting” into a users computer to see what's going on
- [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/)   
  Used this to create a Jira type board to keep track of tasks. Might be more on this later as there's a [API](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/) to it.

Lastly the company has a really good culture that emanates from the top and flows throughout the organization. Comparing the culture from my last company to this one, is - while not quite night/day - is definitely on a different tier maybe server different tiers above the other. It's a real shame that employees can't experience the culture of another company without changing jobs. There are review sites, but those don't do culture evaluations justice.

Stick around and we'll see what the next several months bring!
