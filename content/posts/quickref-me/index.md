All developers end up working with a myriad of technologies during their careers - editors, frameworks, languages, databases, OS'es, etc. We pick them up, use them and then - perhaps - we're off doing something different. We may not touch them for a while. Then suddenly we need to pick one or more of them up and use them again and we're stuck trying to remember the exact command sequence, syntax, API, etc.

I used to buy - when physical books were an actual thing - the small [O'Reilly Pocket Reference](https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Reference-%2528OReilly%2529-34-book-series/dp/B08QZ8GTVV) guides to quickly regain the "gist" of something. Now most of the information is "out there" a Google or AI search away. Still, there's something nice about having a lot of quick reference information on a subject in one "goto" spot.

That's why [QuickRef.me](https://quickref.me/) - an open-source quick reference "cheatsheet" - exists. It's a valuable resource for developers who possess a strong understanding of technology but occasionally require a quick reference guide. The site offers material on a wide range of programming languages, tools, and frameworks, making it an indispensable tool for finding quick and concise information. Whether you are working with popular languages like Python, JavaScript, or Java, or exploring newer technologies such as React or Docker, QuickRef.me has it.

Despite the breadth of topics, QuickRef.me gets you right to the "good stuff". One "click" and you're into an well organized set of information specific to the technology you need. Each guide is structured in a way that presents essential details in a straightforward manner allowing you to quickly scan through the content to find the exact information you need. There's also a robust search functionality for finding specific topics or keywords. It also links out to other relevant sites that cover additional details on a topic.

Since QuickRef.me is open-source, it's current with the latest trends and updates. Users can contribute to the site by suggesting edits or additions to existing reference guides, ensuring that the content remains accurate and relevant. Don't see something? Contribute what you know about a subject to a completely new topic.

QuickRef.me excels in providing comprehensive, user-friendly, and accurate "guides" to a across a big technology landscape. I've found it a valuable tool for finding quick and reliable information when I need a "refresher" on a technology, language, framework or system that I've not used in a while.
